# Texture_Completion

This project is developed within the course "Advanced Deep Learning for Computer Vision" at the TU Munich. The supervisor for my project is Yawar Siddiqui. This project is based on three other projects:
* Occupancy Networks
* Convolutional Occupancy Networks
* Texture Fields

The modified scripts from Occupancy Networks are used for data-processing, 
The from Texture Field

## Usage

First, implement the three Github projects, you can find them in the following linkes: [Occupancy Network](https://github.com/autonomousvision/occupancy_networks), [Convolutional Occupancy Networks](https://github.com/autonomousvision/convolutional_occupancy_networks) and [Texture Fields](https://github.com/autonomousvision/texture_fields).
